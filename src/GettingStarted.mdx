# Getting Started

Welcome to the UI gallery of Constellation DX Components. This guide will help you get started and connect you to the essential resources you need.

## UI/UX Design Guidelines

Before you dive into designing, familiarize yourself with our Constellation design guidelines. They provide valuable insights into our design philosophy and standards.

## Implementing a Constellation DX Component

Before you start to reuse and customize some of the components presented in this UI Gallery, please review our best practices when creating a Constellation DX Component:

- [Design requirements](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/constellation-dx-components/page/constellation-dx-components/custom-components/design-requirements-constellation-dx-components.html)
- [Governance and best practices](https://community.pega.com/event/clsa-community-extension-dx-components-responsible-lsas-guide?)

The Constellation DX Components allows to extend the library of out-of-the-box assets that are tailored to your specific business needed. A Constellation DX Component is built as code using a typical front-end development process and the compiled version of the component is uploaded to the Pega Platform during development and stored as a Rule-UI-Component. This component can be authored in App Studio and configured into a view.

Here are a set o best practices when implementing a Constellation DX Component:

### Separate the presentation from and the business logic

Separate the presentation and the business logic of the component. For consistency, the Constellation DX component should reuse the components already provided by the Constellation component library available at https://design.pega.com/develop.

### Use PCore and PConnect publics API

When making calls to the platform, handle all the requests through the getPConnect object passed to your component. For more details see [Using PCore and PConnect Public APIs](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/pcore-pconnect/page/pcore-pconnect-public-apis/api/using-pcore-pconnect-public-apis.html)

### Use styled component library and design tokens

Reuses the OOTB design tokens provided by the theme and use styled component to add some additional styles to your Constellation DX Component

### Use Typescript

Typescript is highly recommended for writing a Constellation DX component. Strong type checking allows best practices to be enforced when writing code and avoids many errors at runtime.

### Use rem instead of px

REM is a relative unit calculated based on the root font size. It is recommended to use rem as unit for font sizes or spacing rather than px. This ensures that any future change in root font size gets translated accordingly to all components

### Prefer functional components over class components

Functional components helps to group related code together in a single block thus making the code more readable

### Review accessibility of the component before starting to code

If using a 3rd party library to implement a Constellation DX component, it is important to evaluate the library in terms of accessibility compliance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1.
