##  Deployment and Integration Instructions:-

**1.  Create a Data Type for the slider**

      To manage and display the images in the slider component, create a Data Type in Pega **(Example: Banner)** with the following columns:

         - **Id:** Unique identifier for the image.

         - **Title:** Optional title or caption of the image.

         - **Description:** Optional description or metadata for the image.

         - **Image URL:** URL of the image to be displayed in the slider.

         - **Visible:** Boolean field to indicate if the image should be shown in the slider.


Each entry in the Data Type corresponds to an image, allowing for easy updates and management of the content.


Users will create a custom list Data Page **(D_BannersList)** that retrieves records filtered by visibility, using a report definition **(RD_VisibleBanners)**. This ensures that only banners with **Visible = true** are displayed, and it can be seamlessly integrated into components like the Image slider for a dynamic user experience.


**2.  Component Configuration**

      Add the slider component to your **Landing Page** and **Summary panel** using the following configuration:

         - **Data Page:** Specify the Data Page **(Example:- D_BannerList.pxResults)**

         - **Image Source:** Specify the image property.

         - **Title:** Specify the Title property.

         - **Description:** Specify the Description property.

   - **Font Size:** There is no option to change the font size for the title and description.

   - **Font Type:** The components do not support changing the font family for the title and description.

   - **Font Color:** There is no capability to modify the font color for the title and description.
