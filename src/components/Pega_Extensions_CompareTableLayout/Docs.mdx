# Overview

The CompareTableLayout component is a template component that let you compare side-by-side different objects. It will present different instances of an object for comparison and will present the ability to select one of this instance.
To support selection, you need to have a field called ID in one of the properties to render and you need to set a field name that will be used to store the selected value. In the demo, only the 'spreadsheet' format allows to turn on/off the ability to select an object.
