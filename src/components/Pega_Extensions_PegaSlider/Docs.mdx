##  Deployment and Integration Instructions:-

1.  Create a Data Type for the Carousel
      To manage and display the images in the carousel component, create a Data Type in Pega (Example: Banner) with the following columns:
        Id: Unique identifier for the image.
        Title: Optional title or caption of the image.
        Description: Optional description or metadata for the image.
        Image URL: URL of the image to be displayed in the carousel.
        Visible: Boolean field to indicate if the image should be shown in the carousel.

Each entry in the Data Type corresponds to an image, allowing for easy updates and management of the content.

Users will create a custom list Data Page (D_BannersList) that retrieves records filtered by visibility, using a report definition (RD_VisibleBanners). This ensures that only banners with Visible = true are displayed, and it can be seamlessly integrated into components like the Image Carousel for a dynamic user experience.

2.  Component Configuration
      Add the carousel component to your Landing Page and Summary panel using the following configuration:
        Data Page:- Specify the Data Page (Example:- D_BannerList.pxResults)
        Image Source:- Specify the image property.
        Title:- Specify the Title property.
        Description:- Specify the Description property.
