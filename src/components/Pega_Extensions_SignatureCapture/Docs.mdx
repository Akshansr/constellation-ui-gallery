# Overview

This field-level component allows to write a signature and store it in a 'text' field as an svg base64 file. Make sure that the text property size is long enough to
store the svg content. The same content can be rendered as read-only and will display the svg as an image. You can pass the text field to the createPDF shape if you render
the text field as an image inside the section rule.
