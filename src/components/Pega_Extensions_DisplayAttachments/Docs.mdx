# Overview

The Display Attachments allows to render the attachments in a read-only mode. This widget is not a replacement of the attachment widget since it does not let you upload, delete or edit existing attachments.

You can filter the attachments to display by providing a comma-separated list of categories. You can also change the 'displayFormat' to render either as a list (when using in the Utility column)
or as a set of tiles (when rendered in a Details view).

Images can also be rendered in a Lightbox component instead of being opened in a new browser tab.

## Example

Here is an example of using the Display Attachments widget using the 'tiles' displayFormat inside a details tab or using the 'list' displayFormat in the utility column.
