# Overview

The Map component showcases how to run the ArcGIS Map component inside Constellation UI - The [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/) helps build interactive user experiences and 2D and 3D visualizations.

The component supports the following features:

- Center on a global map by providing latitude, longitude and zoom
- Allow to draw a set of positions by clicking on the map - double click to terminate the polyline
- Clear action to delete the trajectory
- Read only mode when put in the display template
- Can pass a URL field type that can be used to store a base64 image of the map

To use this component, you will need an embedded data list with 2 fields: Latitude and Longitude. In a form template, add a new view based on this template and select the 2 properties
from the embedded list data object - make sure to put the Latitude field first. If needed, you can specify a 3rd field on the case type formatted as URL that can hold
an image of the map - the Image field must be large enough to hold the base64 content (see length to 50000) and should not have any validation enabled on the field for URL.

# Example

Here is a demo of how to configure this component in App Studio. For this example, we have created a 'Map' case type and we will render Map component.
The case type is composed of an embedded data list called 'Positions'

To use the template, add the fields to the region in this order
